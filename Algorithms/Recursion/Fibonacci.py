"""
Given a number N return the index value of the Fibonacci sequence, where the sequence is:
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144 ...
the pattern of the sequence is such that each value is the sum of the 2 previous values, that means that for N=5 â†’ 2+3.

For example, if we have a method name fibonacci_recursive,
fibonacci_recursive(6) should return 8, i.e. sum of the numbers in the sequence until index 6. Likewise,
fibonacci_recursive(7) should return 13.

Here we will use recursion and iteration separately to implement the solution.
